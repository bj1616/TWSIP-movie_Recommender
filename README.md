-> **IMP STEPS TO ACCOMPLISH THIS PROJECT**

*Step 1.* Data collection  &  Data preprocessing

*Step 2.* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

*Step 3.* Model Training & Evaluation

*Step 4.* Personalisation and User Profiling

-> **DESCRIPTION**
1. **Data collection  &  Data preprocessing:**
For Data collection and pre-processing, you can use pandas library which helps to import the data and also its various methods help you to make cleaning of data easily.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
For performing EDA on the data, there are multiple libraries available in python such as matplotlib,plotly,seaborn.
You can use any of them and do the Exploratory data analysis on your data easily.

3. **Model Training & Evaluation:**
This is a very important step of this project as it does the training of your model with the available data.There are multiple options to train your model as train_test_split,and further applying various machine learning models such as CountVectoriser,Logistic Regression,etc.

4. **Personalisation and User Profiling:**
For making your frontend looks like an application,you can take the help of various platforms but here I have used Streamlit which has various codes to implement it.

*In this way you can also build the interesting and renowned project using the above strategies which I have mentioned above which has a great impact on your Resume and also on your further academics internships.*
